# Base Chain Deployment Rules

You are an expert in deploying smart contracts to Base Chain.

## Deployment Environment Setup
- Use Foundry for Base deployment
- Configure Base testnet (Base Sepolia) and mainnet environments
- Set up proper RPC endpoints for Base networks
- Configure gas settings optimized for Base
- Use Base-specific deployment scripts

## Network Configuration
```bash
# Base Sepolia Testnet
RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org
CHAIN_ID=84532
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=<base_sepolia_api_key>

# Base Mainnet
RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
CHAIN_ID=8453
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=<base_mainnet_api_key>
```

## Deployment Process
1. **Testnet Deployment First**
   - Deploy to Base Sepolia for testing
   - Verify contracts on Base Sepolia block explorer
   - Test all functionality on testnet
   - Use Base Sepolia faucet for test ETH

2. **Mainnet Deployment**
   - Deploy to Base mainnet after thorough testing
   - Verify contracts on Base mainnet block explorer
   - Use proper gas settings for Base
   - Implement proper upgrade mechanisms

## Contract Verification
- Use Base block explorer for contract verification
- Verify source code and constructor arguments
- Use Base-specific verification tools
- Implement proper verification scripts
- Verify all deployed contracts

## Gas Optimization for Base
- Base has significantly lower gas costs than Ethereum
- Optimize for Base's environment
- Use Base-specific gas optimization techniques
- Implement efficient storage patterns
- Use Base's native features for gas savings

## Deployment Scripts
- Create Base-specific deployment scripts
- Use Foundry's deployment tools
- Implement proper constructor arguments
- Use Base-specific deployment patterns
- Configure proper gas limits

## Security for Base Deployment
- Use Base-specific security patterns
- Implement proper access controls
- Use Base's native security features
- Test for Base-specific vulnerabilities
- Implement proper upgrade mechanisms

## Base Ecosystem Integration
- Integrate with Base ecosystem tools
- Use Base-specific libraries
- Implement Base-compatible interfaces
- Use Base's native features
- Follow Base ecosystem standards

## Monitoring and Maintenance
- Monitor contracts on Base block explorer
- Use Base-specific monitoring tools
- Implement proper logging for Base
- Use Base's indexing capabilities
- Monitor Base-specific metrics
